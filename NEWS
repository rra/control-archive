                   User-Visible control-archive Changes

control-archive 1.9.2 (unreleased)

    Change Subversion to Git in the control.ctl reference to the INN
    version control repository.

    Hierarchy updates:

    * ba.* is now unmaintained
    * Change URLs and control sender address for fido7.*
    * bln.* now uses PGP-signed control messages
    * Update admin group and URL for bln.*

control-archive 1.9.1 (2021-06-27)

    Hierarchy updates:

    * Change the official signing key for the Big Eight hierarchies
    * Use https for the Big Eight web site
    * Remove remnant net.* information and document that it is abandoned

control-archive 1.9.0 (2020-12-24)

    Use gpg1 instead of gpg in the Makefile and scripts/generate-files to
    support older keys.  Suppress warnings about keyring permissions when
    generating files.

    When verifying PGP signatures, require that the headers part of the
    X-PGP-Sig header contain a comma.  This more readily diagnoses a
    missing version field and improves the error message, instead of
    reporting that the Control header is not signed.

    Hierarchy updates:

    * Remove the dictator.* hierarchy (shuttered by its maintainer)
    * Add rocksolid.*
    * Fix line endings in nntpworld.* key
    * Replace the fr.* key and URLs and add a key fingerprint

control-archive 1.8.0 (2018-03-18)

    Support signing IDs with whitespace in process-control.  Most of the
    support was already there, but the code to parse the output from GnuPG
    was only grabbing the first "word."

    Avoid reporting an error when producing a log summary and no log file
    exists for the summary period.

    Switch to gpg1 explicitly, since the code is designed to expect its
    status messages, and add --allow-weak-digest-algos to allow the old
    signatures used by most hierarchies.

    Update URLs to server-patches in README.html.  These have been moved
    to an ARCHIVE subdirectory since they're generally obsolete now.

    Update multiple contact addresses in README.html from tale@isc.org to
    eagle@eyrie.org or usenet-config@isc.org.

    Update README.html documentation of pgpverify to note that it now
    requires Perl 5.003 or later (which is still far older than anyone's
    Perl installation is likely to be).

    Add humanities.* to the README.html instructions for C News and D
    News, and fix a repeated word.  Thanks, Julien Ã‰LIE.

    Add a comment to control.ctl explaining reserved hierarchies.

    Use https for my web site in scripts, documentation, and templates.

    Add SPDX-License-Identifier headers to significant files.

    Hierarchy updates:

    * Drop unused UIDs from the grisbi.* key
    * Remove gov.* configuration

control-archive 1.7.0 (2016-01-03)

    For reserved hierarchies, also drop all checkgroups for the hierarchy
    rather than falling back on the default of mailing checkgroups to the
    news administrator.  Thanks, D. Stussy.

    Drop newgroup and rmgroup messages for control, general, junk, test,
    and to top-level groups.  Thanks, D. Stussy.

    Add clean and distclean targets to the Makefile.

    Hierarchy updates:

    * wpg.* no longer has an active maintainer
    * Update metadata and PGP key for dictator.*
    * Add control.*, junk.*, and to.* as reserved hierarchies
    * Add general.* and private.* as reserved hierarchies due to ambiguity

control-archive 1.6.1 (2014-04-06)

    Hierarchy updates:

    * Update sender for chile.*
    * Update metadata for dictator.*
    * Revert change to the sender for grisbi.*
    * Update PGP key for grisbi.* for new default key ID

control-archive 1.6.0 (2013-06-01)

    In export-control, when copying the control.ctl file and the logs to
    the export directory, set the modification times of the copied files
    to match the modification times of the originals.

    Suppress a stray blank line in the logs when processing invalid
    checkgroups.

    Hopefully improve the details about the formatting and length of the
    newsgroups line and be clearer about how line length is calculated
    with tabs.

    Hierarchy updates:

    * Update sender and PGP information for bofh.*
    * Update sender for grisbi.*
    * Add dictator.*

control-archive 1.5.0 (2011-01-02)

    Fix broken checkgroups processing.  A combination of bugs in the
    initial implementation of chkscope support resulted in the removal of
    the first group listed in a checkgroups followed by ignoring the rest
    of the checkgroups.  The chkscope support should now work as intended.

control-archive 1.4.0 (2010-12-12)

    Add support for chkscope parameters in the checkgroups control
    message.  process-control now correctly filters out out-of-scope lines
    and doesn't apply the checkgroups to out-of-scope entries in the
    current active file, but the scope is not yet correctly used to
    determine the matching control.ctl entry.  Should fix problems with
    processing ka.* checkgroups.

    Suppress Perl warnings from some malformed control messages.

    Hierarchy updates:

    * Update URL for de.*
    * Update all information for ba.* to new hierarchy maintainer
    * Update URL for fr.*
    * Add nntpworld.*

control-archive 1.3.0 (2010-01-17)

    Special-case public hierarchies with no control message senders and
    add a comment saying that the hierarchy is in use, but has no active
    maintainer.  Move nc.*, nersc.*, and nord.* out of special to use this
    new format, and document the extra information about nc.* in the
    hierarchy notes file.

    Support parsing multi-line vectors in the configuration syntax.

    Add a comment field to the configuration syntax and include its value
    in control.ctl before the metadata headers.

    Add a new reserved hierarchy type, for hierarchies that are reserved
    for special purposes.  This is slightly different than any of the
    existing statuses.

    When generating PGPKEYS and README.html, allow for the possibility of
    having no control message senders for abandoned hierarchies.

    The key fingerprint pseudo-header in control.ctl entries now matches
    the syntax of the other pseudo-headers, using a colon instead of an
    equal sign.

    Hierarchy updates:

    * Update description for belwue.* to be more correct
    * Add contact, URL, and fingerprint for belwue.*
    * Add contact, URL, and admin group for bln.*
    * Add fingerprint and admin group for ffm.*
    * Add admin group for kassel.*
    * Remove sender and URL, add admin group for kiel.*
    * Add key URL for muc.*
    * Add new public hierarchy owl.* (Ostwestfalen-Lippe, Germany)
    * Update description for sachsnet.*
    * Add contact, fingerprint, and admin group for stgt.*
    * Add contact, URL, sync server, and admin group for thur.*
    * Remove sender, contact, URL, and sync server for ufra.*
    * Add new private hierarchy ulm.* (Ulm, Germany)
    * Remove control sender for fido.*; the domain is for sale
    * Add information about muenster.* to hierarchy notes
    * Include more information in example.* entry
    * Remove control message processing for fa.*, use no sender template
    * Add more explanation for local.*

    Thanks to Thomas Hochstein for the updates to the regional German
    groups and fido.*.

    Documentation updates:

    * Supersedes is allowed but not recommended in control messages

control-archive 1.2.1 (2010-01-02)

    Hierarchy updates:

    * Add key URL for szaf.*
    * Change szaf.* key-id to Hiertenrat to work around pgpverify bug
    * New key for eternal-september.*

    Documentation updates:

    * Reference RFC 5536 in the config policy
    * Don't mention the unenforced component length limit

control-archive 1.2.0 (2009-12-29)

    When generating a control message report with exclusions, don't send
    the report if all actions during the time period were excluded.

    Add better debugging to control-summary for failure to load the
    template and failure to connect to an NNTP server.

    Install the control-report template on make install.

    Hierarchy updates:

    * Fix pubnet.* URL into the control archive
    * Remove sdnet.* configuration, document in docs/hierarchies
    * Add eternal-september.* from http://www.eternal-september.org/
    * Add szaf.* (private)
    * Update sender for opennews.*
    * Update admin group for cl.*
    * Update URL for hun.*
    * Update URL and add syncable server for nlo.*
    * Remove slac.* and bes.* configuration, document in docs/hierarchies
    * Mention zipnews.* as obsolete in the hierarchy notes file
    * Add admin group for ka.*
    * Update ibm.* information in the hierarchy notes file

control-archive 1.1.0 (2009-01-02)

    In update-control bulkload, accept tabs in newsgroup descriptions and
    change them to spaces.  Tabs are not permitted in the current grammar
    for newsgroup lines or in the upcoming USEPRO standard, but better to
    be liberal when importing from older sources.

    Fix missing variable declaration in process-control and
    update-control.

    Add an install target to the Makefile and updated the installation
    documentation to use it.  The default Makefile target now just builds
    control.ctl rather than building a distribution.

    Change CVS to Subversion in the control.ctl reference to the INN
    version control repository.

    Hierarchy updates:

    * Add grisbi.* from http://news.grisbi.org/
    * Update gnuu.* from http://www.gnuu.de/config/
    * Document um.* removal in docs/hierarchies

control-archive 1.0.0 (2008-11-08)

    Initial public release.
